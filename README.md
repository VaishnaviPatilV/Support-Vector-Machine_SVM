Support Vector Machine (SVM)

🧠 Definition
Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used mainly for classification and sometimes for regression. It finds the best boundary (called a hyperplane) that separates data points of different classes with the maximum margin.

💡 Importance
SVM helps to classify complex data accurately.
It works well in both linear and non-linear problems.
Commonly used in image recognition, text classification, and bioinformatics.

⚙️ Why We Use SVM
To separate different classes of data with a clear boundary.
To handle high-dimensional data effectively.
Works well even when the number of features is greater than the number of samples.

✅ Advantages
High accuracy for classification tasks.
Works well for both linear and non-linear data (using kernels).
Effective in high-dimensional spaces.
Memory efficient (uses only support vectors).

⚠️ Disadvantages
Training time is high for large datasets.
Choosing the right kernel and parameters can be difficult.
Not suitable for very large datasets.
